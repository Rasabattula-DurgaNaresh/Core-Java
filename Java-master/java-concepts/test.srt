1
00:00:02,6 --> 00:00:05,6
- Let's start by defining the terms enterprise

2
00:00:05,6 --> 00:00:08,6
- and enterprise integration.

3
00:00:08,6 --> 00:00:12,6
- An enterprise covers the whole supply chain of a business.

4
00:00:12,6 --> 00:00:14,6
- When I refer to enterprise systems,

5
00:00:14,6 --> 00:00:16,6
- I'm referring to the systems that are participating

6
00:00:16,6 --> 00:00:19,6
- in the supply chain.

7
00:00:19,6 --> 00:00:21,6
- Enterprises include, not only internal systems,

8
00:00:21,6 --> 00:00:24,6
- but external systems as well.

9
00:00:24,6 --> 00:00:27,6
- In order to gain value in the supply chain,

10
00:00:27,6 --> 00:00:28,6
- we need to make these systems communicate

11
00:00:28,6 --> 00:00:31,6
- with one another.

12
00:00:31,6 --> 00:00:34,6
- To accomplish this, we use enterprise

13
00:00:34,6 --> 00:00:36,6
- integration practices.

14
00:00:36,6 --> 00:00:40,6
- Enterprise integration connects disparate systems.

15
00:00:40,6 --> 00:00:42,6
- Connecting these systems is complex.

16
00:00:42,6 --> 00:00:45,6
- Enterprises are always evolving.

17
00:00:45,6 --> 00:00:47,6
- New systems are being built, purchased,

18
00:00:47,6 --> 00:00:50,6
- enhanced and acquired.

19
00:00:50,6 --> 00:00:53,6
- Often we don't control all the systems in the enterprise.

20
00:00:53,6 --> 00:00:55,6
- Finally, systems don't have the same

21
00:00:55,6 --> 00:00:57,6
- protocols for communication.

22
00:00:57,6 --> 00:00:59,6
- They may have different operating systems,

23
00:00:59,6 --> 00:01:03,576
- formats, languages, etc.
