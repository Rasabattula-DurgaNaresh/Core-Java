- Let's start by defining the terms enterprise
- and enterprise integration.
- An enterprise covers the whole supply chain of a business.
- When I refer to enterprise systems,
- I'm referring to the systems that are participating
- in the supply chain.
- Enterprises include, not only internal systems,
- but external systems as well.
- In order to gain value in the supply chain,
- we need to make these systems communicate
- with one another.
- To accomplish this, we use enterprise
- integration practices.
- Enterprise integration connects disparate systems.
- Connecting these systems is complex.
- Enterprises are always evolving.
- New systems are being built, purchased,
- enhanced and acquired.
- Often we don't control all the systems in the enterprise.
- Finally, systems don't have the same
- protocols for communication.
- They may have different operating systems,
- formats, languages, etc.
